# Who am i ?
I am a Software Engineering(i am not developer). I interested in research and development in the field of **threat intelligence**. I had several projects in Python, GO and Rust. Now I am using Rust. I have been using **GNU / Linux** distributions since 2019. And **I love linux**. When I get bored at the computer, I write poetry as an **amateur**. I like to learn new things and share what I learned. You can contact me from the social media accounts below.
