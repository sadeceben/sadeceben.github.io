# Who am i ?
As I wrote in the title of the site, my name is “**Cemal Tiryaki**”. I am a 2nd year student at Fırat University Department of Software Engineering. I interested in research and development in the field of **cyber security**. I had several projects in C#, java, nodejs and Ruby. Now I am using Ruby. I have been using **GNU / Linux** distributions since 2019. And **I love linux**. When I get bored at the computer, I write poetry as an **amateur**. I like to learn new things and share what I learned. You can contact me from the social media accounts below.
